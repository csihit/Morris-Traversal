# Morris-Traversal
Perform inorder traversal without stack or recursion using Morris Traversal. It creates temporary links (threads) to traverse nodes in order, then removes them, leaving the tree unchanged. No extra space, O(n) time, constant memoryâ€”a clever way to walk the tree without baggage!
